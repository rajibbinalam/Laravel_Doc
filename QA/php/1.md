## PHP
### 1. Anonymous Classes:
```php
   interface Logger {
      public function log(string $msg);
   }

   class Application {
      private $logger;

      public function getLogger(): Logger {
         return $this->logger;
      }

      public function setLogger(Logger $logger) {
         $this->logger = $logger;
      }  
   }

   $app = new Application;
   $app->setLogger(new class implements Logger {
      public function log(string $msg) {
         print($msg);
      }
   });

   $app->getLogger()->log("My first Log Message");

//     ------  OR  -----

$data = fucntion(string $data){
   return $data;
};
echo $data('Hello World');
```

### 2. Different Between ```include``` and ```require```:
   ANS:
   ```require``` will produce a fatal error (E_COMPILE_ERROR) and stop the script
   
   ```include``` will only produce a warning (E_WARNING) and the script will continue
   
   So, if you want the execution to go on and show users the output, even if the include file is missing, use the include statement. Otherwise, in case of FrameWork, CMS, or a complex PHP application coding, always use the require statement to include a key file to the flow of execution. This will help avoid compromising your application's security and integrity, just in-case one key file is accidentally missing.
