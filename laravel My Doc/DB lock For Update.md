## DB lock For Update
In a scenario where multiple people are trying to update the same table, and you want to ensure that only one person can update the data at a time, you can use a database lock. Laravel provides the ```lockForUpdate``` method for this purpose.

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;

try {
    DB::beginTransaction();

    // Select the row(s) you want to update and lock them for update
    $user = DB::table('users')->where('id', $userId)->lockForUpdate()->first();  // Query Builder
    $user = User::where('id', $userId)->lockForUpdate()->first();                // Eloquent ORM

    // Perform your updates on $user
    $user->name = 'New Name';
    $user->save();

    DB::commit();
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    DB::rollback();

    // Handle the exception or log the error
}
```

Please note that using locks can have performance implications, and it's important to use them judiciously. In scenarios where contention for the same rows is high, it's crucial to design the application and database schema in a way that minimizes the need for frequent updates to the same records by multiple users simultaneously. Consider whether a different database design or strategy, such as using queues, might be more suitable for your specific use case.
